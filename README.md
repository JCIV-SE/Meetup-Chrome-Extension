## Meetup Chrome Extension

An open-source Chrome extension for Meetup account & group management.

## Motivation

The project was intially conceptualized to streamline meetup.com's UX by creating a ubiquitously available service that allows for basic CRUD functionality on both the events you're a part of and groups you manage. The project is currently in its initial Spec phase and will have little to no maintenance beyond the bugs I come across in my personal use (sorry).
